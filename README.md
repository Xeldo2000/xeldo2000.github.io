IF you want me to explain what everything is

#GLTF FILES

So what these are are the files to controle what the model is the size its fetures and where the textures are comign from

#in the folder GLTF, TEXTURES

if you press ctrl f in the a gltf file and type in uri what you will find is stuff like defualt texture or base color

the textures in the gltf folder are what the textures are so it is jus timaes of what like the wall should look liek or hte floor

# in the gltf folder you will also find scene.bin

this is just defining the shape of the model
