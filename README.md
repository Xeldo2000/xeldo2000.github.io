That is my website for AFRAME
IF you want me to explain what everything is



# GLTF FILES

So what these are are the files to controle what the model is the size its fetures and where the textures are comign from

# in the folder GLTF, TEXTURES

TO explain this
go into the gltf files folder
then click squidword
in the scene.GLTF press crtl F then type in .png you should see thigns like blah blah/blah blah/ defualt base colro or texture

this is just a file locator what the gltf file is looking for. Now to see what it is looking for go bakc into gltf files then squid word then go into textures you will see so many files click on one of them. The picture is what the gltf fiel is textureing a part of the model such as the floor.

# in the gltf folder you will also find scene.bin

TO EXPLAIN WHAT PARTS OF THE MODEL

the scene.bin is just used to define the gemotry of the model for example like the rectangle of a wall in a house.
 
# to put everything together

the scene.bin defines shapes

the scene.gltf file defines where the shapes go and hwo big they are

the textures define what the shapes scene.bin defined look like

then all together we see a 3d model.
